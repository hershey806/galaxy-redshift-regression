# Estimating Galaxy Redshifts from Photometric Magnitudes

In this project, I implemented several types of machine learning models to estimate galactic redshifts from 6 types of magnitudes. I used data from the Galaxy Zoo project (gz2sample.csv) in this project. Sources can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file at the top.
